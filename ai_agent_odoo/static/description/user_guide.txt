The AI Assistant can help with:
- Answering questions about Odoo data (partners, products, sale orders)
- Creating and updating records
- Providing guidance on Odoo features
- Assisting with common tasks

Data Access:
The AI Assistant can access the following types of data from your Odoo database:
- Partners (customers, suppliers, contacts)
- Products (inventory items, services)
- Sale Orders (customer orders, quotations)

When asking questions about your data, be specific about what information you need. For example:
- "Show me the top 5 customers by sales"
- "What products are low in stock?"
- "List all pending sales orders"

The AI will automatically retrieve relevant data from your Odoo database to provide accurate responses.
